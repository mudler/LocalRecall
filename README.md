A lightweight, no-frills RESTful API designed for managing knowledge bases and files stored in vector databases—**no GPU, internet, or cloud services required**! LocalRecall provides a simple and generic abstraction layer to handle knowledge retrieval, ideal for AI agents and chatbots to manage both long-term and short-term memory seamlessly.

Currently, LocalRecall is batteries included and supports a local vector store powered by **Chromem**, with plans to add additional vector stores such as **Milvus** and **Qdrant**. It can easily integrate with LocalAI, LocalAGI, and other agent frameworks, offering an intuitive web UI for convenient file management, including support for raw text inputs.

🔗 **LocalRecall is part of the Local AI stack family:**
